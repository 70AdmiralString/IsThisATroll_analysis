# Description of user list

This is a list of about 944 "suspicious accounts". Reddit believes they work for Russia's "Internet Research Agency" of "Troll Factory". 

# How were these users identified as trolls?

We don't know. Reddit has refused to release this information for fear that the next wave of trolls will use it to evade detection. Reddit has access to information that we do not, such as Private Messages and Upvote/Downvote Records. We think that some of this information was used to classify certain users as trolls, because some users got banned without making a single comment/post and others got banned after displaying no public trolling behavior.
